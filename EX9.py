## Practice Typing code
## Learning Python 3 the Hardway
## Exercise 9

# Here's some new strange stuff, remember type it exactly.

## Defines M-Su for the days as a continuous string
days = "Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun"
## Defines J-A for the months as a continuous string with each on a new line
months = "Jan\nFeb\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nJul\nAug"

## Prints a string with var days added to the string
print("Here are the days: ", days)
## Prints a string with var month added to the string
print("Here are the mouths: ", months)

## Prints each line on a new line and doesn't require multiple print()
print("""
There's something going on here.
With the three double-quotes.
We'll be able to type as much as we like.
Even 4 lines if we want, or 5, or 6.
""")
